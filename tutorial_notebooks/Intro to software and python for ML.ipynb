Always think of the range argument as the number of iterations you want, but note that `i` will take the integer values **up to, but not including** this number. Notice The legend and title is plotted after the for loop is finished since it's not indented. Python is very sensitive to indents for this reason, if you ever get an indent error then you've forgotten to indent or there is too much indent. Indent using the Tab key, unindent using Shift+Tab. The `label` in the plot function, is a keyword argument. This will be used for the legend, to name the independent sine graphs. This also introduces the `.format()` function, use `{}` wherever the value should be in the string, and put the variable name as the argument. \n",
